Sour Grapes is much like her namesake. She appears to be generally in a foul mood and unpleasant to be around. She is often grumpy, and has a feisty temper that can flare up any time, but she isn't that mean when you get to know her. She's a realist, not a pessimist. She has spunk and edge and does things with gusto and likes to seem tough and brave. She's mischievous and likes to play pranks and trick people, similar to many antagonistic characters of the franchise. She is competitive and energetic and is protective of her sister, Sweet Grapes, and always tries to help her. They act like polar opposites, but they are best friends and love each other, a trope often used with twin characters. Sour Grapes starts to seem a bit more 'sweet' in comparison to her cousin, the greedy and social media addicted Raisin Cane. Sour Grapes is often annoyed and groans at the schemes of her cousin. She is more intelligent and clever than the ditsy, head in the clouds Sweet. Sour's grumpy competitive personality makes her very similar to Angel Cake personality wise.",

Sometimes, she wears black athletic shorts like when camping. She has a very punk and edgy style, and is the third tomboy butch character in Strawberry Shortcake, the first being Peppermint Fizz and then Raspberry Torte, and being followed by the 2021 version of Orange Blossom and the mechanic from the 2021 series. She wears green eyeshadow. She is the second character in the franchise to have highlights.",

This Sour Grapes is not a villain, thus being completely different from 1980s and 2003 Sour Grapes. She is tough, competitive, and butchy which makes her seem like the kinder 2009 version of Peppermint Fizz. The 2021 version is monotone, bland, and mostly mute, although she does show some emotion now and then. She rarely speaks with a thick Australian accent. Her style is more goth instead of punk now.",

She's very friendly and kind, and always puts others before herself. However, she has a passion that can not be put out easily and as a result can be stubborn.  She enjoys sports, and music, and dancing. Thanks to Cherry Jam, she becomes a drummer.  Plum is also known to be silly, she laughs a lot and loves things like being a prankster and jokes. She could keep laughing, much like a hyena if given something super funny. However Plum does not overdo it, she tries to not make someone feel bad, should something funny happen to them. But she does try to use jokes to clear up the situation.  With the good comes the bad, negative traits. She lacks leadership skills and happens to be very competitive. As shown when the girls were going to perform in a dance-off and her lack of good judgement and intention to cut out the complicated dance made things very hard for the others and eventually forcing them to drop out with small causalities occurring to each of them due to practicing 24 hours a day. She also panics and gets nervous quickly, suggesting they run in the face of fear. She is also the first to whine in a situation.",

Whenever something seems fake or unreal, she will go out of her way to prove it wrong, but only because she believes it's the best thing to do and she will quit if a proof is given to her.
